1st import the intergrator module to your script.
then declare a Chain_Model Object first. like this:
        Chain_model = intergrator.Chain_Model()

the Chain_Model does not need any arguments. this Chain_Model represents your entire block chain and
includes all the methods attached to a block chain model this are.
    1. addTochain
      ``this method allows you to add data to the chain, it accepts an order Object from the
        database, takes its details and creates a block and adds the block to the Chain_Model
        This Method does not return a value``
        ----usage------
        Chain_Model.addTochain(orderObject)
        ---------------
    2. CheckValidity
      ``This method returns a boolean True or false . the method checks if any of the blocks on the chain
        have conflicting data or are not in the correct flow``
        ----usage------
        Chain_Model.CheckValidity(Void)
        ---------------
    3 getChainDataAsList
      ``This Method returns a list of all the data in the chain blocks as a list``
        ----usage------
        Chain_Model.getChainDataAsList(Void)
        ---------------
